## Overview

This paper is the result of a request from SG1 at the 2018 San Diego meeting to split [P0796: Supporting Heterogeneous & Distributed Computing Through Affinity][p1436] into two separate papers, one for the high-level interface and one for the low-level interface. The high-level interface paper; [P1436: Executor properties for affinity-based execution][p1436] proposes a series of properties for querying affinity relationships and requesting affinity on work being executed. The low-level paper; [P1437: System topology discovery for heterogeneous & distributed computing][p1437] proposes a mechanism for discovering the topology and affinity properties of a given system.
